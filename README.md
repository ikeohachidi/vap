# View a page (VAP)

Small script to view static sites from github locally.

## How to run
#### Building from source
- Clone this repo and run `make build` . You should now have a bin folder with `vap` and `vap.exe`.
- Open `localhost:8080` on your browser

#### Run built binaries
- Clone this repo
- `cd` into the `bin` folder
- run `./vap <repository_url>` if on a mac or linux else run `./vap.exe <repository_url>` if on windows
- Open `localhost:8080` on your browser

#### Motivation
Introducing people to web development has me cloning and deleting a lot repos. No more.
Plus, why not.
